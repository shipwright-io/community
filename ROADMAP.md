# Community-Driven Roadmap

Shipwright's detailed roadmap can be found on the
[Shipwright Overview GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/shipwright-io/projects/6). All
repositories are currently tied to the release cycle of the core
[build](https://github.com/shipwright-io/build) sub-project. Shipwright aims to issue minor
releases quarterly, using the same major and minor semantic version across repositories.
