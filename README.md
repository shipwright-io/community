# Welcome to Project Shipwright!

This is the central hub for community process documentation, as well as assets owned by the project.

## What is Shipwright?

Shipwright is a framework for building container images on Kubernetes.
The core consists of the following code repositories:

* [build](https://github.com/shipwright-io/build) - the Build APIs and associated controller to run builds.
* [cli](https://github.com/shipwright-io/cli) - the `shp` command line for Shipwright builds
* [operator](https://github.com/shipwright-io/operator) - an operator to install Shipwright components on Kubernetes via OLM.

Documentation is spread across the code repositories, and is consolidated in the [website](https://github.com/shipwright-io/website) repository.
